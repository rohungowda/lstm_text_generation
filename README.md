Introduction:
This ltsm python file is a documentation of my work using an bidirectional LSTM model for text generation of musical lyrics using the one million spotify dataset found on Kaggle. 
The resulting model was not able to reach the objective of text generation but it was a great experience for me becasue I learned about pytorch, LSTM, regularization, and data preprocessing.

Regularization techniques learned:
  Early stopping
  Dropout layer
  Batch normalization layer
  Weight decay
  Scheduled learning rate
  
Deep learning Layers learned:
  LSTM layer
  Linear feed forward layer
  dropout layer
  batch normalization layer
  Linear Classification layer


Conclusion: Even though this project was not able to reach the objective it taught me a wealth of information on LSTMS and deep learning in general. This repository is just for my own record keeping,
but anyone can use this file to learn more about pytorch and LSTMs like I did.
